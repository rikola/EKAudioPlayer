# ðŸŽ¶ EKAudioPlayer ðŸŽ¶

A framework for easily playing music from the iTunes library. A replacement for MPMusicPlayerController.  
This abstracts all the obtuse playback and playlist management logic so you can focus on playing tunes ðŸŽ¶.

All you have to do to implement this in your own app is to set your `ViewController` as the player's delegate,
and then link up your buttons to the `EKAudioPlayer` interface.  

The `EKAudioPlayer` is a singleton object that can be instantiated on a root view controller  or `AppDelegate` to play music throughout all screens of your app, no matter the view hierarchy.

### Objects: 
* EKAudioPlayer: Controls music playback and scrubbing. Also maintains a playlist of songs.
* EKPlaylist: Maintains a playlist of songs as a collection type item.

### Pleasantries:
* Updates the "Now Playing Center" (aka. lock screen) with your music info, and receives playback control input from both the lock screen and external things like the headphone buttons or a speaker dock.
* Audio level metering
* Interpreting whether to skip to a previous song or return to the beginning when pressing "Skip back".
* Provides important playback event notifications, such as `trackDidChange`, `endOfQueueReached`, and `playbackStateChanged`. These allow easy interface updates to take place.
* You can instantiate the player with the results from `MPMediaQueries`, so accessing the iPod library is super easy.
* The `nowPlayingItem` exposes a `MPMediaItem`, so it comes with all the info needed to populate a nice interface (artwork, artist, etc).

### Why:
When I needed to integrate iPod-like music playing into my app, I found MPMusicPlayerController too 
limited for my needs. Audio level metering is completely absent from MPMusicPlayerController and requires moving down
to AVFoundation. Due to this snafu, I created this.
